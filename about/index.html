  <h1>About</h1>
  <h2 id="Armstrong_Athletics">Armstrong Athletics</h2><p>Hi, my name is Louis Armstrong, the creator of Armstrong Athletics. I am a twenty
eight year old certified personal trainer from Pacifica, California. I train locally along
the peninsula of California. </p>
<p>I have been working in the fitness industry for four years
now and I love it. It is extremely rewarding to help a client achieve their fitness goals.
Sports and fitness has been a part of my life since I was about nine years old, with
my first experience being, when my parents enrolled me in martial arts lessons.
From there I was engaged in sports all the way through high school to junior college,
playing football and running track. Growing up playing football presented me with many
tools that helped me when I was younger and still help me to this day. </p>
<p>It takes hard work to prepare for a football season, lots of hours must be dedicated to working out
and practicing, many sacrifices must be made in order to be physically and mentally
prepared. You donâ€™t break your leg the first year playing high school football and throw
in the towel, which is what happened to me. Instead I focused and pushed myself to return the next season and start at my position. </p>
<p>It takes discipline to train your mind and
body to eat the proper foods, rest when its time to rest, and push your body to its limits.
I applied these aspects to life, whether it was track, football, school, or relationships
and work. I still compete in athletic events and sports, however I turned my focus
towards personal training and helping others. I have decided to make it my goal to help
as many individuals as possible achieve their fitness goals. It is my mission to provide
a unique training experience for each person I train. Training is my passion and helping
others is a gift. I would like to share both with you.</p>
